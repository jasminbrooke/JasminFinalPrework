            <p>
                One of the most beloved birds in the eastern United States is the Northern Cardinal. 
                It generally lives in forests, thickets and suburban gardens and is easy to attract to backyard feeders.
                Known for its bright crimson red plumage, the male of this species will feed the fawn (light brown) female
                as part of its courtship behavior. Their diet includes grains, seeds and insects. They love sunflower seeds!

                While just as recognizable as the Northern Cardinal, the sight of a Blue Jays at a feeder is a little more divisive. 
                They can be considered noisy and aggressive, and may chase smaller songbirds away from their preferred food sources, 
                which consists of seeds, nuts, insects and soft fruits. On the upside, 
                they are also great at alerting others to the presence of hawks.
                The male and female mate for life, and are similar in size and plumage. 
                They work together to build nests and care for young. These Corvids are extremely intelligent!
